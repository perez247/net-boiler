This file consist of instructions for properly using the backend

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites


#### Using Docker (Recommended)

* If you have already installed Docker on your system then skip this part. Visit [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/) to download and install docker.

* From the root directory in the command line run the following (sudo is only required for Mac and Linux OS).
    ``` 
        [sudo] docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
    ```
